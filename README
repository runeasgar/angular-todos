What you need for this to work:
1. A Drupal 8 site with this app in a subfolder (e.g., drupalroot/angular).
2. Drupal 8 REST GET, POST, and PATCH methods enabled with hal+json format and cookie authentication turned on.
3. A "To Do" (to_do) content type with a "Complete" (complete) boolean field.
-- This is a consistency issue. Should fix.
4. Modify app.js's configuration section with the appropriate values.
